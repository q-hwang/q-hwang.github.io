<p> If you'd like to chat with me on general research and career advices (e.g. taking classes during undergrad and applying to PhD etc), come to my weekly Office Hour on 4:30-5:30pm PST on Tuesday [<a href="https://stanford.zoom.us/j/97059574935?pwd=b3VxQWppdTlHa0E4aC9XRU5vNmhxUT09">Zoom</a>]! </p>
    <p>  
    I especially encourage people from nontraditional backgrounds (either at Stanford or not) to join us, and I will try my best to either help personally when I can or conect you with people who I believe can give better advice/help. I intend to host this OH for at least for this quater, and potentially continue it to the whole academic year in the future. </p>
